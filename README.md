# Market-Mix-Model_using_XgBoost

This project demonstrates how to use XgBoost, a popular machine learning algorithm, to build a market mix model (MMM) that can quantify the impact of various marketing channels on sales and optimize the marketing budget allocation.

## Data

The data used in this project is `MMM_data.csv`, which contains the weekly sales and marketing spend data for a hypothetical company from January 2016 to December 2018. The data has 12 columns:

- `DATE`: The week ending date
- `revenue`: The sales revenue in thousands of dollars
- `tv_S`: The TV advertising spend in thousands of dollars
- `ooh_S`: The out-of-home advertising spend in thousands of dollars
- `print_S`: The print advertising spend in thousands of dollars
- `facebook_I`: The influencer marketing spend on Facebook in thousands of dollars
- `search_clicks_P`: The search engine marketing spend on pay-per-click ads in thousands of dollars
- `search_S`: The search engine marketing spend on search ads in thousands of dollars
- `competitor_sales_B`: The competitor sales in thousands of dollars
- `facebook_S`: The Facebook advertising spend in thousands of dollars
- `events`: The event marketing spend in thousands of dollars
- `newsletter`: The newsletter marketing spend in thousands of dollars

## Notebook

The main notebook for this project is `MMM_using_XgBoost.ipynb`, which contains the following steps:

- Data exploration and visualization
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Model interpretation and analysis
- Marketing budget optimization

The notebook can be run on Google Colab or locally with the required packages installed.
